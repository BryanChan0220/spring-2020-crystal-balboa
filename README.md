# Supperwhere

Supperwhere is an application that allows users to figure out dining recommendations based on their dietary preferences and meal history. The app will help locate restaurants for the user based on those preferences. The application aims for making the dining experience more convenient for the user by providing quick and easy options for them to use to tailor their preferences. 

## History

The idea for Supperwhere comes from a commonly recurring dillema: What do I eat for dinner? The decision making process for what to get for dinner can be a huge time-sink, and often times leaving the decision to chance can result in regret or second guesses. The idea for supperware was to use data to justify an optimal dinner decision, rather than just a random suggestion, or flipping a coin.
