### General Behavioral Rules
**Do's**:
- **Respect** different opinions on issues and ideas
- Respectfully accept any constructive criticism
- Be understanding of any issues a member is going through
- Focus on the group's interests
- Use respectful and inclusive language

**Don'ts**:
- Use derogatory, sexual/vulgar, hateful language that would make any member uncomfortable
- Engage in any form of harassment to any of the group members
- Focus on your self-interests
- Shrug off constructive criticism
- Any other conduct that is deemed detrimental to the group

### Standup Schedule
Standup meetings will occur from 12:20 PM - 12:35 PM on Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays. They will be held in person at the NYU Bobst Library.

### Responding To Messages
Team members are expected to respond to team-related messages within **2 hours** of the message or their last class, whichever is later, on weekdays. On weekends and holidays, team members must respond by the day for requests made in the morning (before 12pm EST) or by the next morning on requests made at night (past 7pm EST).

### Covering Our Members' Work
If a member lets the team know that they are dealing with an urgent matter and can't work on the project, we'll make sure one of us can cover the work that member can't complete in time for a sprint.

### Git Workflow

Members should fork their repository to work on their local machines to prevent conflicts from happening inadvertently. Members should keep their forked repository in sync with the original repository. Before committing their branch, members should make sure to pull to their repository to prevent merge conflicts after pushing their branch.

### What's Considered Done

An issue, user story, or any other contribution is considered done when **all** members have checked and verified it through their own local machines.

### Contributing Rules

When contributing to this project/repository, you **must** notify the rest of the members that you want to contribute to this project. You **must** let the members know what specific contribution you want to make and you **must** get all of their confirmations that it is ok to make that contribution. If someone is already committed to making the same contribution you want to do, you _may_ help them out if needed, but it is their responsibility to complete those contributions unless they are willing to transfer that responsibility to you.

### Final Note
**All of these rules are to be enforced by all members of the team.**
