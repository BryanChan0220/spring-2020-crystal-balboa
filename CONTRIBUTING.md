### Standup Schedule
Standup meetings will occur from 12:20 PM - 12:35 PM on Mondays/Wednesdays/Fridays. They will be held in person at the NYU Bobst Library.



### Responding To Messages
Team members are expected to respond to team-related messages within **2 hours** of the message or their last class, whichever is later, on weekdays. On weekends and holidays, team members must respond by the day for requests made in the morning (before 12pm EST) or by the next morning on requests made at night (past 7pm EST).

### Covering Our Members' Work
If a member lets the team know that they are dealing with an urgent matter and can't work on the project, we'll make sure one of us can cover the work that member can't complete in time for a sprint.
